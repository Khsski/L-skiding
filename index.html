    <p>Skidding is when someone takes code they didn’t write or understand and uses it as if it’s their own. It’s copying and pasting from GitHub, forums, or Discord and pretending you built it. Sometimes skidders go even further by rebranding someone else’s work and trying to take credit. It’s not learning. It’s not developing. It’s lying.</p>
    <p>Stopping skidding isn’t impossible, but it does take honesty. If you’re using someone else’s script, tool, or exploit without understanding how it works, stop pretending you made it. Start by learning the basics. Don’t try to look cool by flexing stolen code you can’t explain. Build something simple from scratch, even if it’s small. That’s real progress.</p>
    <p>Don’t rely on AI tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or Phind to do all the work for you. Using AI isn’t the same as knowing how to code. If all your projects are made by copying AI output, you’re not a coder — you’re just rerunning someone else’s logic. It’s okay to use tools for help, but not to fake skill you don’t have.</p>
    <p>If you catch yourself saying “I’m in too deep” — stop. That’s not a reason to keep faking. That’s you admitting it’s gotten out of control. You’re not going to learn anything by lying about what you can do. You either pull back now, or you stay stuck pretending.</p>
    <p>Skidding might get you clout in the short term, but it won’t make you better. Eventually people notice. You get exposed, ignored, or replaced by someone who actually knows what they’re doing. The real flex isn’t looking smart. It’s getting smarter.</p>
    <p>You don’t need to steal to be part of the scene. You don’t need to lie to fit in. Take the time to actually learn and you’ll get further than any skid script ever could.</p>
